# localGov | un-offical

## IDEA
An integrated digital platform designed for local government entities and their constituents
to facilitate the monitoring and prioritization of issues raised by the local populace.

The system allows citizens to propose, request, or report concerns within their constituency, 
which are subsequently subject to a crowd-sourced evaluation process where suggested problems 
receive upvotes to indicate the level of severity and importance.
